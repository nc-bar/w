<pre><code>$ ed filename   # open the file &#39;filename&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>the contents of the file are copied to a buffer; if no file is provided, the buffer is empty.  changes are always applied to the buffer.  if changes are not saved, they are lost when closing the editor.</p>

<p>there are several versions of ed, with slightly different arguments and commands; the <code>-G</code> argument runs gnu&#8217;s <code>ed</code> in compatibility mode.</p>

<p>interacting with <code>ed</code> is similar to interacting with a shell.  a prompt is displayed while it reads lines from standar input.  if the input doesn&#8217;t match with a command, an error is returned.</p>

<p>the default prompt is an empty string, but it can be changed using the <code>-p</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>$ ed -p-  # use &#39;-&#39; as the prompt
</code></pre>

<h3 id="addresses">addresses</h3>

<p>the user enters commands in the standard input.  most commands consist of only one line and are of the form:</p>

<pre><code>[address[,address]]command[parameters]
</code></pre>

<p>the commands are applied to the lines given by the addresses.  an address can be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a positive number</p>

<pre><code>1p  prints the first line of the buffer
0p  error: 0 can&#39;t be printed
1,4p    print lines 1 through 4
2   set current 2 as the current line
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>a negative number counts backwards from the last line (so <code>-1</code> is <code>$-1</code>, that is, the previous line to the last; <code>-0</code> is <code>$</code>)</p>

<pre><code># &#39;-&#39; is not the prompt, there is no prompt
-0p print the last line
-1p print the second-to-last
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>.</code> represents the current address; it is tracked by ed</p>

<pre><code>.p  print the current line
.   print the current line
.,3p    print the lines between the current address and the third line
d   delete the line in the current address
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>0</code> is a virtual line above all others.  it&#8217;s not posible to read or write into this address.  it is useful, for example, to write a line before the first one (that is, bellow <code>0</code>)</p>

<pre><code>0p  error: 0 can&#39;t be printed
0a  add text at the beggining of the buffer (the previous first line will be the second line.
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>$</code> is the last line in the buffer</p>

<pre><code>1,$p    print the entire file
1,$d    erase the content in the buffer
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>two addresses separatad by a comma represent the range of lines between them, with both ends included:</p>

<pre><code>    1,2 first and second lines
    1,$ all lines in the buffer
</code></pre>

<p>the second address has to be bigger than the first:</p>

<pre><code>    3,1 error: 3 &#62; 1
    1,1 first line
    .,3 lines between the current address and the third line.
        if &#39;.&#39; is bigger than 3, then the address is invalid
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>the symbols <code>+n</code> and <code>-n</code> refer to the nth line after and prior to the current address respectivly.</p>

<pre><code>.n  # print the current line and its number
3   # current address is 3
+2  # advance the current address two places
5   # now current address is 5
-2  # go back two places
3   # now current address is 3
-   # equivalent to -1
2   # now current address is 2
+   # equivalent to +1
3   # now current address is 3
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>. <code>&#47;re&#47;</code> search the line for a match to the regular expression <code>re</code>.  the search starts with the inmediate address after <code>.</code>, and wraps to the first line if it reaches the end of the buffer.  if a match is found, the current address is set to the matched line.</p>

<pre><code>    a       # adding some lines to show &#47;re&#47; working

    .n      # print current address
    1   uno # current address is set to 1

`&#47;re&#47;` matches the first line it finds and stops so, in the example above, the search stoped at line 1 even though line 2 (dos)

<ul>

<li><p>it&#8217;s possible to mark lines in ed, so they can be referenced in future commands.  the marked lines are also valid addresses,

<h3 id="commands">commands</h3>

<p>commands cause ed to perform an action upon one or more lines.  if the user enters (at the prompt) an address followed by a letter matching a command, then the commands is executed on the addressed lines.  most commands have a default line to use if no address is provided.</p>

<pre><code>    $ cat file
    first line
    second line
    $ ed -G -p- file
    39
    -,p     # &#39;,&#39; is the entire file, and &#39;p&#39; is the print command
            # it prints the lines especified by the address
    first line
    second line
    -,n     # print the lines and the line numbers
    1   first line
    2   second line
</code></pre>

<p>in the list of commands below default lines are between <code>()</code>; for example <code>(.)p</code> means that the command <code>p</code> applies to the current line if no address is specified.  also, the prompt is set to <code>-</code>, when there is one, and the shell prompt is <code>$</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>(.)a</code> adds lines entered by the user (after the command is entered) after the line addressed.  the lines are read from the standard input.  to go back to the prompt write a line containing only <code>.</code>.  the current address is set to the last line added.</p>

<pre><code>-,p

</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>(.)i</code> reads lines from stdin and adds them above the address.  the current line is set to the last one added.  entering a line with <code>.</code> by itself takes ed back to the prompt.  it behaves similarly to the <code>a</code> command, but inserts the lines above the address.</p></li>
<li><p><code>(.,+)j</code> replaces the addressed lines by the line resulting of their concatenation.  the current address is set to the resulting line.</p>

<li><p><code>(.)klc</code> sets a mark identified by the lowercase character <code>lc</code>.  marked lines can be refered to by <code>lc</code> in, for example, further commands.</p></li>

<li><p><code>(.,.)p</code> prints the lines in the address.  the current line is set to the last line printed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>(.,.)s&#47;re&#47;replacement&#47;x</code> searches in the addressed lines for the <code>re</code> pattern one at a time and replaces it with <code>replacement</code>. if <code>x</code> is <code>g</code> then every match is replaced; if <code>x</code> is a positive integer <code>n</code>, then only the <code>n</code>th match is replaced; if <code>x</code> is not specified, only the first match is changed.  finding no matches is an error.  the current line is the last one affected.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>an unscaped <code>&#38;</code> in <code>replacement</code> is changed to the current match.  if <code>replacement</code> is <code>%</code> the one from the last substitution is used.  for <code>replacement</code> to contain a newline, it must be scaped with <code>\</code>.</p>
