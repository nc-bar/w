# One two two five

For some trivial reason I started looking for patterns behind the sequence `1-2-2-5`. More formally, finding a sequence of integers `a(n)` where `a(1) = 1`, `a(2) = 2`, `a(3) = 2`, `a(4) = 5`. The following are some solutions I found before getting bored.

## Polynomial Interpolation

[Polynomial interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation) can be used to find a polynomial which passes through a set of points. Using the points

        (1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 2) (4, 5)

gives the polynomial

        p(x) = 1 + (x-1) - 1/2*(x-1)*(x-2) + 2/3*(x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3)

which evaluates to

	p(1) = 1
	p(2) = 2
	p(3) = 2
	p(4) = 5

in the points enumerated above. Then `a(n) = [P(n)]` (where `[x]` means the integer part of `x`) gives the sequence 

	1-2-2-5-15...

## Pi

Given that the first 4 elements in the sequence are between `0` and `9`, it could be possible to find the sequence in a non periodic irrational number's decimal representation. If so, defining `a(n) = (p-1+n)th decimal in x` where `x` is the irrational number and `p` is the position at which the sequence occurs, solves the problem.

Choosing `x = pi`, a [search](https://angio.net/pi) finds the sequence at position `p = 9416`. Then

	a(n) = (9415 + n)th decimal in pi

gives the sequence

	1-2-2-5-7....

It's easy to find a closed form for this `a(n)` by using a [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula) (which does the heavy lifting) for the nth digit of pi.

The same technique could be used with other irrational numbers such as [e](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html) (with no guarantee of success).

## Almost Fibonacci

The sequence `1-2-2-5` is very similar to the first Fibonacci numbers `0-1-1-2-3-5...`. A slight modification in Fibonacci's definition:

	b(n) = b(n-1) + b(n-2) + (-1)^(n+1) with b(0) = 0 and b(1) = 1

results in 

	0-1-2-2-5-6...

Then `a(n) = b(n+1)` produces

	1-2-2-5-6...

A closed form for this `a(n)` can be found by using [Fibonacci's closed form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Closed-form_expression):

	fib(n) = (phi^n - psi^n) / (phi - psi)
	a(n) = fib(n+1) + (-1)^(n+1)

Where [phi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) is a well known constant and `psi = 1 - phi`.

## Almost Fibonacci v2

Another way of getting the sequence `1-2-2-5` from Fibonacci's is to define

	a(n) = fib(n+1) + g(n)

where

	g(n) = 0   if n is odd
	g(n) = n/2 if n is even
	
	fib(n) = n-th fibonacci number = (phi^n - psi^n) / (phi - psi)

Then `a(n)` expands to

	1-2-2-5-5-11-13...

Again, it's possible to write a closed form expresion by noting that

	g(n) = (n/2)*sin( (3/4)pi + ((-1)^(n+1)) * (pi/4) )

so

	a(n) = fib(n+1) + (n/2)*sin(3/4)pi + ((-1)^(n+1))*(pi/4)))

## Perfect squares

A [perfect square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number) is an integer `n` such that `n = p^2` for some integer `p`:

	perfect squares = 0-1-4-9-16-25-36-49...

The sequence `a(n) = perfect squares between 1 and n! + 2` follows the pattern

	1-2-2-5-11...

To show it, here's `n! + 2` and a list of perfect squares

	n! + 2          = 3-4-8-26-122...
	
	perfect squares = 1-4-9-16-25-36-49-64-81-100-121...

## Some other ideas

*Train a simple neural network* (a 2-layer perceptron maybe) with the set

	{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 5)}

Then, define `a(n) = [r(n)]` where `r(n)` is the output of the trained neural network. Since the output of neural networks are matrix multiplications, a closed form for the sequence `a(n)` will exist. If I get time to do this and it works I'll update the post.

If `p(n) = number of primes between 1 and n`, then `p(n) = 0-1-2-2-3-3-5`. There is probably a function `h` such that `p(h(n)) = a(n)`. Didn't follow through with this idea since the perfect squares one is similar.

The difficulty of this sequence, at least for me, rests mostly on the `2-2` part, because all the initial patterns that I thought of, and are made of integers, are strictly growing. One way of turning `1-2-2-5` into a strictly growing funcion is to do something like `a'(n) = 2^(n-1) - a(n) = 2-4-6-13...` and then `a(n) = 2^(n-1) - a'(n)` gets defined (of course `2^(n-1)` is just one posibility); *in that way, finding a pattern for `2-4-6-13...` is equivalent to finding one for `1-2-2-5`*.

I tried with different transformations but I felt that it was getting tedious and decided to move on.

*The way `a(n)` grows can be obtained by subtracting two functions `f` and `g` that intersect each other in two points like this*:


	/\
	|
	|             . .  *
	|           .     x      x = intersection
	|         .      *  .    * = g
	|       .      *     .   . = f
	|     .      *       
	|    .     *
	|   .   * 
	| * x *
	+---------------------->


If the bad ASCII art was not enough, I'm refering to functions such as `2^n` and `n^2 + c`. The idea is that the distances between such functions will grow and then decrease, just like the sequence does in the middle (`2-2`). For example, I tried this by subtracting two polynomials of degree two, so it leads to a system of equations and with a bit of luck the system could be solved and a solution found. I decided not to invest more effort since the system could have no solution and was too much mechanical work.

	h(x) = x0 + x1*X + x2*X^2 - (y0 + y1*Y + y2*Y^2)
	h(0) = x0 - y0 = 1     (start from 0 to get a cleaner equation and then correct the indices)
	....
	....


*The function `l(n) = The amount of bits needed to represent n` almost works: `1-2-2-3`*. There's probably a transformation that results in `l(t(n)) = a(n)` but I couldn't find it.

*Moving around the binary representations of the numbers of the sequence*:

	1  2  2  5
	----------
	1  0  0  1
	0  1  1  0
	0  0  0  1

Some possible transformations are logical functions with a constant, find a matching cellular automaton, etc. I decided not to pursue this ideas since it would take too much time.

Some combinatorics problems look almost like the sequence, but they grow too fast after `2`. In some of those problems the growth of the possible states is similar to the growth of `a(n)`; *there's probably some classic combinatorics problem that can be parametrized in such a way that results in the sequence*. I couldn't find one that fits perfectly but the idea seems to have some acceptable probability of working.
