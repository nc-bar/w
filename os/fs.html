<h3>File Systems</h3>

<p>File systems are a way of organizing data in a storage medium, to accomplish some design objectives, such as fast retrieval, redundancy, fast writes, etc. Files are the fundamental unit for user interaction with the file system; they usually consist of a sequence of bytes. Also, files are named, so they can be referenced when operating on them.</p>

<p>Operations in most file systems include <strong>open</strong>, <strong>close</strong>, <strong>read</strong> and <strong>write</strong>. The open operation opens a file in the file system, giving to the process that called the operation a file descriptor, an identifier for that file, with which it can reference it during further operations; in case the file referenced doesn't exist, it could create it. Close is the reverse operation. Read and write operations can add and retrieve information stored into a file, in any part of the file.</p>

<p>In order to reference a file, a name is given to it. In UNIX like systems, such as Linux or openBSD, a filename is a string of characters separated by '/' which denotes a hierarchical separation between files. This introduces a new concept: the directory. A directory groups files and other directories under a common name, forming a tree, called a directory tree:</p>

<pre><code>/
|
+---------+-------+
|         |       |
/bin    /usr    /home
                  |
                  |
          +---------------+
          |               |
      /home/user1      /home/user2
</code></pre>

<p>Another interesting operation on file systems is the mount operation. Mounting refers to hanging a directory tree view of a file system on a node of the directory tree. With this operation is possible to have a directory tree composed of different file systems and different devices. For example, let's say a usb storage device is connected to the computer and the system automatically mounts it into the current directory tree, under /home/user2/devices/usb/:</p>

<pre><code>/
|
+---------+-------+
|         |       |
/bin    /usr    /home
                  |
                  |
          +---------------+
          |               |
      /home/user1    /home/user2
                          |
                     /home/users2/devices
                          |
                     /home/users2/devices/usb
                          |
                        .....
</code></pre>

<p>Now, all the files within the usb storage device can be accessed by prepending /home/users2/devices/usb to their name. This kind of uniformity in dealing with files on different devices and file systems allows the programmer to abstract the particular details of each, and only use the same operations for all of them. These operations are provided as part of the operating system services, in the form of system calls. In UNIX operating systems, system call such as:</p>

<pre><code>int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
int close(int fd);
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
</code></pre>

<p>are used for any kind of file. The kernel knows what kind of underlying file system a file is in and, when receiving call to perform an operation, it applies the right algorithms and protocols to interact with the hardware and data structures of the appropriate file system. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system">Virtual File System</a>(vfs) in operation. The vfs is a layer of abstraction on top of other files systems; this provides the uniform access talked about above, defining a set of operations that can be performed in every file system.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The indirection that the Virtual system provides allows for interesting applications, with almost no cost to programmers. For example, the storage medium could be behind a network, and the kernel would access the network with the right protocols and operate on files remotely, transparently to the programmer.</p>

<p>In operating systems based on Unix, the standard interfaces provided by file systems (open, read, write) are used to represent other resources than storage hardware. For example, in Linux, the proc file system gives information about kernel data structures related to processes; in this directory there's a directory of the name /proc/[pid] for every running process by pid inside of which related information can be found, such as /proc/1000/cmdline contains the command line string used to launch the program. It's also possible to write into certain files and change some process attributes.</p>

<p>This approach of exposing interfaces as files was pioneered by Unix and taken to the extreme in systems like <a href="https://9p.io/plan9/">plan9</a>, in which, most resources are accessed through files. It provides an example of the abstractions provided by the operating system, shaping the way in which the system as a hole feels; if I'm programming for Unix like systems, and need to interact with the system, I'll first check if reading a file can give me the information I need, or writing a file can change what I want, and then use text manipulation tools such as grep, sed, etc.</p>

<p>One important difference between file systems is the type of file access they allow. Some allow for sequential access and others provide random access. In the first type, it's only possible to read from beginning to end, not directly in the middle or the end. The latter gives the possibility of accessing any byte in the file directly; in this cases, the operation seek is usually provided, which lets a program put the pointer inside the file (where the read or write operations take or add data) into an arbitrary position.</p>

<h4>The fat file system</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/FAT">File Allocation Table</a> (fat) file system considers a storage media as an array of clusters, which are contiguous areas of storage in the device. A table, called file allocation table (hence the name of the scheme), implements a set of linked lists, one for every file, containing the sequence clusters where a file is stored. Each entry in the table has the address of the next cluster or a distinctive value indicating the end of the file. So, a file, which is stored in several clusters, not necessarily contiguous, is a linked list of clusters. For example to read some data in the third cluster, first we find the first cluster in the table, from then we get the address of the third cluster.</p>

<pre><code>simplified fat table

cluster | next cluster
--------+-------------
   0    |    1
   1    |    END
   2    |    4
   3    |    EMPTY
   4    |    END
</code></pre>

<p>In the example, we have two files. One spans the 0 and 1 clusters and the second the 2 and 4.</p>

<p>The fat tables are located in the disk and the layout proposed by this system is something like:</p>

<pre><code> +-------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------+
 | boot record |  file allocation table 1   |   file allocation table 2  |   data area |
 +-------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-------------+
</code></pre>

<p>A directory in this system is a file containing directory entries. This directory entries have information about files in that directory, including the name, first sector, and other important metadata. So, to find the file /documents/file.txt, first we search in the directory entries of the root file for the documents file; after getting the data, we can know the clusters corresponding to the directory /documents, so we can read its own directory entries, looking for the one containing the name file.txt. This directory entry will contain the address of the first cluster. With the direction of the first cluster, and the file allocation table, it's possible to finally read the file. The root directory is always at the end of the second fat table, so it's always possible to find it.</p>

<p>Given that secondary storage media access is comparatively slower, the fat table can be kept in memory for efficiency reasons. The downside of this approach is that if the system goes down, the changes since the last time it was saved too disk are lost. For this reason, periodically the fat is saved to permanent storage.</p>

<p>Several formats of the fat file system have been created, fat32, fat16, fat12, which change the format a little, but the principle remains the same. The main difference is the amount of bits that can use to address clusters, and so, the amount of clusters they can use. For example, fat32 has, of course, 28 bits of addresses.</p>

<h4>The ext2 file system</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html">ext2</a> file system is based on the i-node data structure. An i-node represents an object on the file system (e.g a file); it contains pointers to blocks of storage and the metadata of said object (permissions, owner, last modification timestamp, etc.). Some of those blocks of storage are also i-nodes, implementing another two levels of indirection.</p>

<p>A file in the system is referenced by an i-node and its contents are saved in storage blocks. The i-node points to those objects in a specific way:</p>

<pre><code>i-node pointers

+-----------------------------+
| first block address         |-------&gt;block with file contents
+-----------------------------+
| second block address        |-------&gt;block with file contents
+-----------------------------+
| ...................         |
+-----------------------------+
| 12th block address          |-------&gt;block with file contents
+-----------------------------+         +--------------------------+-----&gt;block with file contents
| indirect block address      |--------&gt;|block filled with pointers|  ...
+-----------------------------+         +--------------------------+-----&gt;block with file contents
|doubly-indirect block address|-----+
+-----------------------------+     |      +------------------------------------------+
                                    +-----&gt;|pointer to indirect address pointer blocks|
                                           +------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>So, a file that spans 12 blocks can be reached by reading the first 12 entries in the i-node pointers. If more blocks are needed, then, the block address can be found in the block pointed to the 13th entry, which contains a pointer to a block of addresses, where the data is. So, to know where in the device the file is, we only need to get a hold of its i-node.</p>

<p>A directory is implemented as a file holding directory entries. The directory entries contain a name, i-node tuple, for every file or directory it contains; so if an i-node for a directory is found, a list of it's files and directory can be obtained by iterating its content. The root directory, by standard, is always at the second i-node. To find a directory, starting from the root, read the directory entries, find the next directory and keep doing it recursively until the last directory, and then, locate the file.</p>

<p>In ext2, the device is divided up into block groups, each containing the same amount contiguous blocks and i-nodes pointed to them. The i-nodes are contained in tables, with each block group having its own. Each block group contains a bitmap of allocated blocks and another one for free i-nodes. So the contents of, e.g. a file, are in blocks of some block groups:</p>

<pre><code>storage device
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| block group 0 | block group 1 | ............. | block group n|
|               |               |               |              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>The number of block groups are determined by the capabilities of the device, e.g, the number of blocks. This information, along with all the metadata of the file system, is located in the superblock. The superblock is, by standard definition, at the byte number 1024 of the device; information such as amount of i-nodes, amount of blocks per block group, free i-nodes, etc, is contained in this superblock. Because of its contents, its very important for mounting the system, and so, several backups of the superblock exist, in different block groups.</p>

<p>After the superblock the block group table is located; it describes where the important information is in each block group, such as the table of i-nodes, the free i-nodes and blocks bitmap, etc.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, in order to find a file or a directory, finding it's i-node was sufficient and the procedure for doing so was explained. The missing piece of information is, how are the i-nodes referenced? and how to find one?. Each i-node has a unique number, counting from 1. As said before, the second i-node, that is the i-node number 2, is reserved for the root directory. With that reference and the information of how many i-nodes per group there are, simple arithmetic (i-node number / i-nodes per group) gives the block group where the i-node is. Then, inside the i-node, computing the rest of the previous division gives the place inside the i-node table (which we can find using the block group table).</p>

<p>To summarize, the layout of a storage device formatted using ext2 is:</p>

<pre><code>storage device
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| boot data and | block group 0 | ............. | block group n|
| information   |               |               |              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>And each group contains:</p>

<pre><code>+-------------------------------+--------------+--------+--------+--------+
| superblock | Block group      | block bitmap | i-node | i-node | data   |
|            | descriptor table |              | bitmap | table  | blocks |
+------------+------------------+--------------+--------+--------+--------+
    1 block      x blocks           1 block     1 block  y blocks  z blocks
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on the version of ext2, the superblock may or may not be replicated in each block group.</p>

<h4>GFS</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://research.google.com/archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf">Google File System</a> (gfs) was design by Google in order to solve some internal storage problems. It's last version was released in 2010. It's an example of a file system running in several machines (distributed) and also implemented in user space; some computers are used as storage, one as a master which keeps metadata and responds to several control messages, and the clients making the requests to both kinds of servers.</p>

<p>The design objectives address specific needs, and observations made by Google engineers.</p>

<p>Each computer in the system is going to be built out of inexpensive commodity components prone to failure; so, the system can not assume reliability from its hardware components, and so, must provide it itself.</p>

<p>The expected number of files are around a million, typically 100MB in size each, but often multi-GB files are expected. The system should optimize for large files and should manage files of any size, but small ones don't require optimization. The kinds or reads expected are large and sequential reads, from hundreds of KB to several MB's each; small random reads are often a few KB's in size. When a read is performed, often the following adjacent data are also read. Once written, files don't change often. The typical change through a write are append operation with the same kind of data magnitudes as in reads. Random writes should be supported, but no optimizations should be needed. An operation for atomic appends for concurrent clients operating in the same file should exist without imposing synchronization logic over the applications.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://research.google.com/archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf">paper</a>, application using this file system benefit more from a high, sustained bandwidth than low latency.</p>

<p>The file system is made up of the following parts or concepts:</p>

<p>The <strong>chunks</strong> are a similar concepts as blocks in ext2. They are a chunk of storage, each one of the same size. <strong>Files</strong> are stored in several chunks. Each chunk has a 64 bits immutable unique identification number, called <strong>chunk handle</strong>. The size of the chunks chosen was 64MB, in order to decrease the amount of chunks, which helps to keep their ids in a memory table. Also, the clients need less communication with the master to figure out where the chunks are, since more data is in the same chunk.</p>

<pre><code>                          Chunk handles
+-------+
| file  |---------------&gt; 0xffff
|       |---------------&gt; 0xaa23487ff
|       |---------------&gt; 0xadf112304
+-------+
</code></pre>

<p>A <strong>chunk server</strong> is in charge of storing the chunks. Write and read operations reach these servers and are applied to the data or the data is transferred. They are implemented on top of a Linux server and file system in user space. Each chunk can be saved as a file in the underlying file system. For reliability, the chunks are redundantly stored in several chunk servers; this implies that synchronization mechanisms are needed when a mutation is performed.</p>

<p>File system metadata is stored and handled in a centralized server called the <strong>master</strong>. It stores information such as the file tree and its access control list, chunk id's and the map between files and chunks; those data structures are kept in memory to make the system more efficient. This server responds to control messages such as a client asking where a files' chunk is. It also handles asking the chunk servers to communicate their state, periodically removing unused chunks, helping synchronize writes through the lease mechanism, and asking the chunk servers for their state at start up. Master servers are implemented as user processes running on top of, for example, Linux. The master server operates and stores its data structures in memory, so to protect the system from failures, an operation log is kept in disk and safely replicated, so the state of the operating system can be reestablished; to decreased startup time after a failure, a snapshot of the structures in memory is taken after the operation log saves enough operations.</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>clients</strong> communicate with the master server to get information about the file system and interchange data with chunk servers. It can be implemented as code library which follows the API to talk to the servers. To reduce the amount of contention in the master server, the client caches metadata.</p>

<p>Together, all the above pieces form a <strong>gfs cluster</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>+----------------------------------+
| master server:                   |  chunk handle and location
| - file tree                      |----------------------------&gt;+-------------------+
| - chunk handles -&gt; chunk servers |                             |Application through|

      |                     |                                      |          |
      |instructions to      |chunk server                          |          |

|chunk server 1| .... |chunk server n|                                        |
+--------------+      +--------------+----------------------------------------+
Linux file system      Linux file system
</code></pre>

<p>The namespace  is the collection of file names in the system. As usual, they are a combination of characters separated by /, for example /home/user. All namespace operations are carried out in the master server. In order to create a file, the client sends a control message to the master, which adds the file name into the namespace. Since several clients could be trying to perform the same action, or make changes to the namespace concurrently which could induce an inconsistency, a series of read and write locks are used to synchronize the operations. When a new file is created, chunks need to be allocated for it, which the master is also in charged of; by sending instructions to the chunk servers to allocate a chunk and associate it with the provided id, and also. Finally, the master will update its data structures to reflect the change.</p>

<p>Since reliability is expected of the system, but the hardware won't provide it, the master is also in charged of setting up replicas for the recently created chunks. Those replicas serve 2 purposes. First, in case of hardware failure, data lost is prevented by replication. Second, the master performs load balancing, so clients can ask different servers for parts of the data, also better using the available bandwidth.</p>

<p>To read a file, a client needs the chunk containing the data. Since a file can have several chunks, and each chunk is of fixed size, the byte offset in the file can be used to compute the chunk number. With that data, the client sends a request to the master (if the information is not cached), expecting a response with the chunk handle and location it needs; the request includes the file name and chunk number, used by the master server to perform a lookup.</p>

<p>Once the client has the chunk handle and location (chunk server), it sends a data request to the appropriate chunk server. The request includes the chunk handle and the range of bytes the chunk server should transfer. The client should cache the metadata to speed up its operations and to decrease the load on the master.</p>

<p>Since writes can be done concurrently on the same file by more than one client, and the data is replicated across many chunk servers, writes are a bit more complicated. Changes to the data should be done in every replica; to do so, the master chooses one of the servers as the primary chunk server temporarily (every 60 seconds, the primary server can ask to renew). This process is called giving a lease. The primary server is in charged of serializing the operations upon the chunk, and the other replicas have to apply the operations following that serialization.</p>

<p>When a client wants to write to a file, which finally translates to writing into a chunk, it asks the master for the primary chunks server and the secondary replicas. If no server was established as primary, the master chooses one, and sends back the decision to the client. The client then sends the data to all the replicas, and, after confirmation of the transfer, it sends the operation to perform. The operations are performed first in the primary server, and if no errors occur, the serialization of the operations are sent to the secondary replicas, who then perform the operations.</p>
