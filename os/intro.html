<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
An operating system is a program 
that controls the hardware resources in one or more computers.
It gives programmers a simpler interface
to the hardware and other programs.
It implements concepts such as <i>processes</i> or <i>files</i>;
it manages resources so the programmer doesn't need to.
</p>

<p>
The abstract interface implemented by an operating system
helps in:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> <u>Portability:</u>
	a program can <i>open</i>, <i>read</i>, <i>write</i> or <i>close</i> a file
	without having to control the hardware or worrying what fileystem the file
	is in.
	The same can be said about protocols for communicating with devices,
	the details of some hardware (e.g. the speed rotation of a hard drive).
	</li>

	<li> <u>Security:</u>
	the integrity of an user's data,
	the reliability of the services,
	etc.,
	is easier when an operating system is in charge of
	managing processes,
	memory,
	file system access,
	user sessions,
	etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The operating system consist of a <i>kernel</i>
and a set of tools for the user.
The kernel is the low level code 
which interacts directly with the hardware, 
has full access to the hardware,
etc.
A kernel by itself is not very useful, 
at least from the user perspective; 
a set of tools,
called <i>system programs</i>,
are also considered to be part of the operating system.

What is part of the operating system and what isn't,
is not very clear,
e.g. is the compiler part of the operating system? 
and a standard library?
the editors?.

It gets more confusing in the case of
microkernels, exokernels, etc.
</p>

<p>
Here, the term operating system is used interchageably with kernel.
</p>

</pre></p>

<p>This simplified model applies to most computers used everyday.</p>

<p>A <i>bus</i> is a pathway where information can be sent and received.

They carry data between the memory, the devices, and the cpu's.
Of course, there's actually several buses,
such as the internal buses connecting the components of the cpus,
the one between the memory and the cpu's, and others.

Different buses usually have different technologies and protocols,
due to their design constraints:
does it need to be fast?
carry a lot of data?
or be resistant to errors?.

When the cpu needs to talk to I/O devices to carry some operation,
such as painting a pixel in a monitor
or print a document,
the data will flow from the cpu, to the bus into the device
(of course, the opposite flow is also possible).

Given that several elements of the system access the bus concurrently
some protocol is needed to make sure the information doesn't get corrupted.
</p>

<p>
The I/O devices are the physical interface between
the computer and the outside world;
the monitor, printer, keyboard, mouse are all I/O devices.
Typically, each device is connected to a controller
and the operating system is in charge of 
knowing the exact operations the device is capable of and how to induce them,
by writing bytes in their control and data registers.
Device <i>drivers</i> are operating system's components
in charge of talking to some device
or class of devices.
</p>

<p>
A program is a list of instructions the cpu understands.
These instructions are fetched from <i>memory</i>
and executed by the <i>cpu</i>.
In a very simplistic way this is all the cpu does:
<p>

<p><pre>
	1. fetch next instruction
	2. execute instruction
	3. go to 1
</pre></p>

<p>
The main memory (ram) is divided into cells,
each one with an <it>address</it>.
</p>

<p>
An <i>interruption</i> is an asynchronous calling for the processor's attention.
It causes the cpu to jump to an <i>interrupt handler</i>,
which is an operating system routine 
(another list of instructions stored in memory).
</p>

<p>
In most modern cpus, both hardware and software
are able to interrupt the processor.
</p>

<p>
Typical examples of interruptions (or <it>traps</it>) are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> a device interrupts the processor to 
		communicate it finished some operation </li>

	<li> a program issues an interrupt to do some low
		low level task (implemented as part of the operating system) </li>
</ul>

<p>
In the context of operating systems,
one of the most important interruptions is launched by the internal clock.
A circuit sends electronic pulses in fixed intervals of time,
causing the cpu to interrupt it's normal cycle 
and execute the interrupt handler.
This address can be set by the programmer (using a table of function pointers)
or is fixed by the computer architecture.
The list of instructions executed by the processor while interrupted
are called interruption routine,
interrupt handler or
interrupt service routine.
The last instruction of these routines send the processor
back to the last instruction before the interruption.
</p>

<p>
The same mechanism can be used by I/O devices to communicate with the cpu: when they require the processor intervention, they send an interrupt and wait for a response. This is usually a better way of doing it, instead of having the processor polling the resource waiting for something to happen. Also, programmers can cause these interruptions (by using system calls or by causing an exception or a trap, which are similar concepts) to interact with the hardware or processes safely through the operating system.
</p>

<p>
Modern cpu's offer several mechanisms for protecting a 
<i>multiprogramming system</i>,
i.e a system with several programs running concurrently.
One of the  most important of all
is the concept of <i>processor modes</i>. 
Some architectures, such as amd64,
have at least two modes:
<i>kernel mode</i> and <i>user mode</i>. 
The first one is a processor state in which
all resources of the cpu architecture are accessible.
It's in this mode that the kernel runs, 
because it has access to all memory addresses, 
instructions, 
etc.
The other mode is the user mode. 
In it, programs have a set of instructions and resources they can use.
If a process breaks the rules set by the architecture, 
it triggers an exception in the processor 
and a context switch occurs, 
i.e. the cpu goes from user mode to kernel mode, 
and a routine defined in the kernel gets executed,
usually killing that process.
</p>

<p>The program below uses a protected instruction. <i><a href="www.nasm.eu">nasm</a></i> can compile the program and <i>ld</i> links it, producing the executable:</p>

	global _start

	section   .text
	_start:	
		mov  rax, 1                       ; system call for write
		mov       rdi, 1                  ; file handle 1 is stdout
		mov       rsi, message            ; address of string to output
		mov       rdx, 13                 ; number of bytes
		syscall                           ; invoke operating system to do the write
		wrmsr		                      ; privileged instruction, can only run in ring0
		mov       rax, 60                 ; system call for exit
		xor       rdi, rdi                ; exit code 0
		syscall                           ; invoke operating system to exit

	section   .data
	message: db  "Hello, World", 10	  ; note the newline at the end
</pre></p>

<p>
The process (i.e. a running program) throws and error, 
most likely <i>Segmentation Fault</i>.
To execute the instruction <i>wrmsr</i>
the process needs kernel priviledge
(in other words, the processor has to be in
kernel mode).
</p>

<p>
This is an example of a program causing an exception 
(after the cpu fetches the instruction <i>wrmsr</i>,
an exception occurs causing the cpu to move the fetching target 
to the appropriate exception handling routine 
and ultimately causing the operating system to kill the process).
</p>

<p>
The <i>amd64</i> architecture refers to kernel mode as <i>ring0</i>.
The operating system creates the process 
and puts the processor in user mode;
when executing <i>wrmsr</i>,
the processor launches an exception
and jumps to a routine in memory,
defined in the kernel,
which handles the error.
</p>

<p>
In order to use those restricted resources
(reading or writing to or from disk, 
communication between processes, etc.),
user mode programs have to ask the operating system
to do it in their behalf, 
through carefully designed interfaces known as <i>system calls</i>;
For example the <i>write</i> system call is used to
write into a file.
</p>

<p><pre>

	process --> syscall(write)                                    process
	---------------------------+--------------------------------^---------
	                           |                                |
	                           +---> kernel routine ---> ret ---+
	kernel mode
</pre></p>

<p>
Operating systems use this separation to accomplish their main goal,
which is to give programmers a simpler interface to the messy,
complicated low level resources 
and to manage them in an efficient, secure way.
</p>

<p>
The processor fetches instructions from a medium of storage,
or <i>memory</i>. 
This memory, 
usually called main memory, 
is a relatively fast device 
which stores process instructions and data.
this memory is usualy called <i>RAM</i> memory 
(Random Access Memory). 
It is orders of magnitude faster than disks,
but orders of magnitude slower than cpus.
To solve this problem, 
the processor uses a <i>cache</i>,
that is,
an intermediate, 
faster,
storage unit which saves recent results,
so it's not necessary to fetch them again from memory 
until they become invalid 
or need to be removed due to space constraints

<p>
The allocation an deallocation of chached objects.
follows rules defined by the particular processor organization;
but it is almost always based
in the observation that
processes tend to request
memory addresses which are near each other
in space and time. 
</p>

<p>
The storage capacity of a computer 
can be represented as pyramid in which
data stored in slower but abundant storage (cheaper)
gets cached into more expensive and
faster, 
but less available
(expensive)
storage:
</p>

<p><pre>
	|
	|            |
	|            |                  |
	| disks ---> | main memory ---> | cpu cache ---> | cpu registers
	|            |                  |
	|            |
	|
</pre></p>

<p>
Both main memory and the cache are volatile:
after the power is shut down the information is lost.
Therefore programs must be saved into more permanent storage,
such as 
magnetic 
or solid state 
disks to persist data between shutdowns.
This is usually where the kernel resides: 
when the system boots,
a special program called the bootloader,
saved in a special region of the disk, 
loads the operating system kernel into memory
and starts it's execution.
</p>

<p>
In multiprogrammed operating systems, 
several processes are using the memory at the same time.
This could create a lot of problems 
and security concerns,
so modern cpus have capabilities 
to help the operating system protect
a process' memory area.
A solution to this problem 
is through the concept of paging, 
in which physical memory
are divided into contiguous intervals 
of adresses of  some fixed size,
called pages,
o the kernel can restrict the memory 
a process can use.
This method is called <i>Paging</i>,
and is a common way to implement <i>virtual memory</i>,
</p>

<p> In virtual memory,
the operating system,
using processor features,
keeps a map between memory pages and real memory addresses. 
A process is given a list of virtual pages,
which map to real memory. A virtual memory page
can be moved to secondary storage 
(a hard drive for example);
this is called <i>swaping</i>.
</p>

<p>
When a page was moved from memory to disk,
i.e. swaped,
and a process tries to read it,
a <i>page fault</i> error is triggered by the processor.
A routine is called automatically
to handle the error. 
This routine is part of the operating system;
using the virtual memory map,
it loads the requested page into main memory,
and resumes the process execution.

<p>
The virtual memory can be implemented
in a per process basis.
The memory is presented to the process
s if it were the only one in execution. giving the appearance to each process that they have almost the entire memory to themselves.
Others mechanisms than paging, 
suc as segmentation,
exist,
but are not often used.
</p>

<p>Much of the operating system's
interaction with processes
is trying to protect them from each other.

<h4> Operating System Services </h4>

<ul>
	<li><u>Process management</u>: 
		the operating system must manage 
		several processes executing in the same environment, 
		keeping the system as a whole running securely and efficiently. 
		This processes sometimes need to communicate with each other, 
		so it must also provide the mechanisms to achieve 
		<i>inter-process communications</i>
		and the resources to do it safely and correctly.
		It's possible that some processes behave badly 
		(intentionally or not) so there must be a way to control them.</li>

	<li><u>Memory Management</u>: 
		the memory is a vital resource of a computer system, 
		and therefore, 
		must be managed efficiently and securely.
		This can be done by the operating system in a transparent way,
		without the knowledge of the application programmer,
		using the tools the processor provides for such a purpose.</li>

	<li><u>I/O</u>: 
	to be useful a computer needs to 
	take in input from outside it's system 
	and return an output to the outside world. 
	As explained earlier, 
	to help programmers to focus on solving new problems, 
	and given their complicated interfaces, 
	hardware is managed by the operating system.
	Among this devices used to interface with the real world, 
	the storage devices such as disks, 
	are specially important. 
	The operating system must provide simple interfaces to work with them. 
	</li>

	<li><it><u>Security</u></it>: the operating system must enforce rules
		so that a multi-user and multiprogrammed 
		system is usable and secure.</li>
