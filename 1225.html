<h1 id="One%20two%20two%20five">One two two five</h1>

<p>For some trivial reason I started looking for patterns behind the sequence <code>1-2-2-5</code>. More formally, finding a sequence of integers <code>a(n)</code> where <code>a(1) = 1</code>, <code>a(2) = 2</code>, <code>a(3) = 2</code>, <code>a(4) = 5</code>. The following are some solutions I found before getting bored.</p>

<h2 id="Polynomial%20Interpolation">Polynomial Interpolation</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation">Polynomial interpolation</a> can be used to find a polynomial which passes through a set of points. Using the points</p>

<pre><code>    (1, 1) (2, 2) (3, 2) (4, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>gives the polynomial</p>

<pre><code>    p(x) = 1 + (x-1) - 1&#47;2*(x-1)*(x-2) + 2&#47;3*(x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3)
</code></pre>

<p>which evaluates to</p>

<pre><code>p(1) = 1
p(2) = 2
p(3) = 2
p(4) = 5
</code></pre>

<p>in the points enumerated above. Then <code>a(n) = [P(n)]</code> (where <code>[x]</code> means the integer part of <code>x</code>) gives the sequence </p>

<pre><code>1-2-2-5-15...
</code></pre>

<h2 id="Pi">Pi</h2>

<p>Given that the first 4 elements in the sequence are between <code>0</code> and <code>9</code>, it could be possible to find the sequence in a non periodic irrational number&#39;s decimal representation. If so, defining <code>a(n) = (p-1+n)th decimal in x</code> where <code>x</code> is the irrational number and <code>p</code> is the position at which the sequence occurs, solves the problem.</p>

<p>Choosing <code>x = pi</code>, a <a href="https://angio.net/pi">search</a> finds the sequence at position <code>p = 9416</code>. Then</p>

<pre><code>a(n) = (9415 + n)th decimal in pi
</code></pre>

<p>gives the sequence</p>

<pre><code>1-2-2-5-7....
</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s easy to find a closed form for this <code>a(n)</code> by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula">formula</a> (which does the heavy lifting) for the nth digit of pi.</p>

<p>The same technique could be used with other irrational numbers such as <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html">e</a> (with no guarantee of success).</p>

<h2 id="Almost%20Fibonacci">Almost Fibonacci</h2>

<p>The sequence <code>1-2-2-5</code> is very similar to the first Fibonacci numbers <code>0-1-1-2-3-5...</code>. A slight modification in Fibonacci&#39;s definition:</p>

<pre><code>b(n) = b(n-1) + b(n-2) + (-1)^(n+1) with b(0) = 0 and b(1) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>results in </p>

<pre><code>0-1-2-2-5-6...
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>a(n) = b(n+1)</code> produces</p>

<pre><code>1-2-2-5-6...
</code></pre>

<p>A closed form for this <code>a(n)</code> can be found by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Closed-form_expression">Fibonacci&#39;s closed form</a>:</p>

<pre><code>fib(n) = (phi^n - psi^n) &#47; (phi - psi)
a(n) = fib(n+1) + (-1)^(n+1)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">phi</a> is a well known constant and <code>psi = 1 - phi</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Almost%20Fibonacci%20v2">Almost Fibonacci v2</h2>

<p>Another way of getting the sequence <code>1-2-2-5</code> from Fibonacci&#39;s is to define</p>

<pre><code>a(n) = fib(n+1) + g(n)
</code></pre>

<p>where</p>

<pre><code>g(n) = 0   if n is odd
g(n) = n&#47;2 if n is even

fib(n) = n-th fibonacci number = (phi^n - psi^n) &#47; (phi - psi)
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>a(n)</code> expands to</p>

<pre><code>1-2-2-5-5-11-13...
</code></pre>

<p>Again, it&#39;s possible to write a closed form expresion by noting that</p>

<pre><code>g(n) = (n&#47;2)*sin( (3&#47;4)pi + ((-1)^(n+1)) * (pi&#47;4) )
</code></pre>

<p>so</p>

<pre><code>a(n) = fib(n+1) + (n&#47;2)*sin(3&#47;4)pi + ((-1)^(n+1))*(pi&#47;4)))
</code></pre>

<h2 id="Perfect%20squares">Perfect squares</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number">perfect square</a> is an integer <code>n</code> such that <code>n = p^2</code> for some integer <code>p</code>:</p>

<pre><code>perfect squares = 0-1-4-9-16-25-36-49...
</code></pre>

<p>The sequence <code>a(n) = perfect squares between 1 and n! + 2</code> follows the pattern</p>

<pre><code>1-2-2-5-11...
</code></pre>

<p>To show it, here&#39;s <code>n! + 2</code> and a list of perfect squares</p>

<pre><code>n! + 2          = 3-4-8-26-122...

perfect squares = 1-4-9-16-25-36-49-64-81-100-121...
</code></pre>

<h2 id="Some%20other%20ideas">Some other ideas</h2>

<p><em>Train a simple neural network</em> (a 2-layer perceptron maybe) with the set</p>

<pre><code>{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 5)}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, define <code>a(n) = [r(n)]</code> where <code>r(n)</code> is the output of the trained neural network. Since the output of neural networks are matrix multiplications, a closed form for the sequence <code>a(n)</code> will exist. If I get time to do this and it works I&#39;ll update the post.</p>

<p>If <code>p(n) = number of primes between 1 and n</code>, then <code>p(n) = 0-1-2-2-3-3-5</code>. There is probably a function <code>h</code> such that <code>p(h(n)) = a(n)</code>. Didn&#39;t follow through with this idea since the perfect squares one is similar.</p>

<p>The difficulty of this sequence, at least for me, rests mostly on the <code>2-2</code> part, because all the initial patterns that I thought of, and are made of integers, are strictly growing. One way of turning <code>1-2-2-5</code> into a strictly growing funcion is to do something like <code>a&#39;(n) = 2^(n-1) - a(n) = 2-4-6-13...</code> and then <code>a(n) = 2^(n-1) - a&#39;(n)</code> gets defined (of course <code>2^(n-1)</code> is just one posibility); <em>in that way, finding a pattern for <code>2-4-6-13...</code> is equivalent to finding one for <code>1-2-2-5</code></em>.</p>

<p>I tried with different transformations but I felt that it was getting tedious and decided to move on.</p>

<p><em>The way <code>a(n)</code> grows can be obtained by subtracting two functions <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> that intersect each other in two points like this</em>:</p>

<pre><code>&#47;\
|
|             . .  *
|           .     x      x = intersection
|         .      *  .    * = g
|       .      *     .   . = f
|     .      *       
|    .     *

<p>If the bad ASCII art was not enough, I&#39;m refering to functions such as <code>2^n</code> and <code>n^2 + c</code>. The idea is that the distances between such functions will grow and then decrease, just like the sequence does in the middle (<code>2-2</code>). For example, I tried this by subtracting two polynomials of degree two, so it leads to a system of equations and with a bit of luck the system could be solved and a solution found. I decided not to invest more effort since the system could have no solution and was too much mechanical work.</p>

<pre><code>h(x) = x0 + x1*X + x2*X^2 - (y0 + y1*Y + y2*Y^2)
h(0) = x0 - y0 = 1     (start from 0 to get a cleaner equation and then correct the indices)

<p><em>The function <code>l(n) = The amount of bits needed to represent n</code> almost works: <code>1-2-2-3</code></em>. There&#39;s probably a transformation that results in <code>l(t(n)) = a(n)</code> but I couldn&#39;t find it.</p>

<p><em>Moving around the binary representations of the numbers of the sequence</em>:</p>

<pre><code>1  2  2  5
----------
1  0  0  1
0  1  1  0
0  0  0  1
</code></pre>

<p>Some possible transformations are logical functions with a constant, find a matching cellular automaton, etc. I decided not to pursue this ideas since it would take too much time.</p>

<p>Some combinatorics problems look almost like the sequence, but they grow too fast after <code>2</code>. In some of those problems the growth of the possible states is similar to the growth of <code>a(n)</code>; <em>there&#39;s probably some classic combinatorics problem that can be parametrized in such a way that results in the sequence</em>. I couldn&#39;t find one that fits perfectly but the idea seems to have some acceptable probability of working.</p>
